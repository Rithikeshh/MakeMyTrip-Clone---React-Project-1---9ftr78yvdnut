                <p>Q - How can I avail budget air tickets on MakeMyTrip?</p>
                <p>A: It’s super-easy to avail budget airfare while booking your cheap flight tickets on MakeMyTrip.

                <p>Q - Why could I not avail the flight booking offers at the time of checkout?</p>
                <p>A: MakeMyTrip makes use of a world-class real-time reservation database to list airfare and availability. As dynamic changes in airfare take place, or the available flight tickets sell out, the database reflects the changes in real-time. Hence, we suggest, you double-check online flight booking prices when purchasing flight tickets, as the airfare might have been dynamically updated since you first selected the air travel dates or planned your itinerary.</p>
